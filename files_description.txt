python files (not plots):
[Organism]_simulations = split of cat/ana based on energy carriers for that organism
effect_of_variability = variability of cat/ana split based on energy carriers for E coli on glucose
functions_precursors = file that contains the functions to calculate the biomass production flux distribution and the simulations for E. coli
precursors_calculations_otherorgs = the calculation of the biomass production for all the other organisms


npz files:
EFMs_biomassprod_model = EFMs that were enumerated using CNApy for the biomass production model

xml files: 
iML1515_macroBOF_core = E coli model that we used for the simulations

Result files, folder structure (xlsx)
[organismname]: all (normal) simulations for that organism for the split based on energy carriers
Precursor_simulations_Ecoli: simulations of the exchange based on precursors for E coli
Precursor_simulations_otherOrgs: simulations of the exchange based on precursors for all other organisms
Variability_check: simulations with alternative EFMs for the exchange of energy carriers


Excel input files:
Input file for each simulation


Python files to make figures:
heatmap_plot
plot_Ecoli_ATPfrac
plot_matrixplots_allorgs
plot_respirofermentative_multipleDs
plot_Stouthamer_barplot
plots_threeparts


Figure files missing:
- all organisms bar plot
- corellogram
- comparison neidthart (is that in the heatmap plot file?)
- macromolecules consume more glucose (appendix)
- Variability of precursor simulations


To do:
refactor
	separate_cat_ana_anycofactor2 -> separate_cat_ana_anycofactor
	check if get_rank_check is necessary twice? 
change file desinations in all simulations files to only have the folder structure
Also ecoli_nitrogensources is gone now
	Have separate folder for overflow?
Test separate_cat_ana with chatGPT comment if it works
